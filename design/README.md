# Fullstack development test

## Overview

This exercise is meant to evaluate your abilities to work in fullstack development. You are expected to review the specifications in this document, and produce an implementation that fulfills the requirements.

## Explanations

Please implement a basic Blog with at least the following pages:

1. Signup Page
1. Login Page
1. New Article Page
1. Edit Article Page
1. Articles List Page
1. Show Article Page
1. Search Article Page

The blog works according to the following rules:

* An article is accessible by anyone - logged in or not - when the attribute `published` is set to `true` and the published date is in the past.
* The blog has multiple authors (= signed-in users). Articles can only be edited or deleted by their authors.
* Authors can access/edit/delete any of their articles.

## Mockups

You're free to add in more features and improve the UX/UI as you like. Below are mockups for the individual pages.

## Additional specifications

* The backend should be implemented with Rails.
* The frontend can be either from Rails, or any frontend framework (e.g. React, Angular, Vue, etc)
* You can add any new features you think will impress us.
* If you have any questions, you can either ask us for clarifications, or you can take assumptions that you document somewhere in the project.
* Please share your work by forking this repo, committing your work, pushing these commits to your fork, then inviting us on your fork for evaluation.
* Please add a Markdown file to document things like: how to run the project, assumptions you took during development, etc.
